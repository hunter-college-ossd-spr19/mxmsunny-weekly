Hey there! We have been tasked to narrow down the search of a project that we want to contribute to. For me, I have decided to contribute to
the <strong>Open Source NYC App</strong>, which is a tool that will track the number of contributions. 

After attending the <em><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-NYC/events/258592674/">Open Source NYC meetup</a></em> held on February 20th, the information,
questions, ideas have all piqued my interest. Their goal is to use this tool for an event they are planning to hold over the summer. By tracking
the number of contributions, they will rank the users on a leaderboard-esque ranking system. Another mandatory aspect of the project is that
it is opt-in, so people would either have to log in/create an account or send an email of interest. Those who are on top of the leaderboard will
receive prizes, which is the incentive for their project. Furthermore, the amount of points gained by the users are all weighed differently. For
example, accepted pull requests will receive more points than that of rejected ones. Therefore, we need to find a way to pull down GitHub statistics
and implement them to the app.

In my case, I still am not too confident in my coding skills, but I hope that being part of this community and building this app as a team will help
me not only improve my coding, but also my communication skills in a quasi-professional environment. Diving into my pool of strength and weaknesses,
I would say, I am more interested in mainly coding the web interface, designing the visuals, and hopefully back-end. Even though I'm not confident with my coding skills,
I am willing to learn, and make contributions. It's kind of daunting to start a project from scratch, but I am excited to see how our efforts and
contributions will come into fruition.

Additionally, we were tasked to read <u><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a></u>. This was a really interesting read as the author, Eric Steven Raymond, distinguishes the cathedral and bazaar styles of coding. In the 19 lessons he
has stated in this reading, he shows us how to make a successful project. He uses Linux as his guiding example, as it was an inspiration for him to test out
open source software. By contributing popclient, a POP(<em>Post Office Protocol</em> client that is used to check and deliver mail, he shortly gained ownership 
from the original owner. After some changes, he released an early release to the public and many people began contributing to it, leading to more and more
releases. What really stuck out were the following lessons:

<ul>
	<li>10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.</li>
	<li>12. Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.</li>
	<li>13. "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.</li>
	<li>18. To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.</li>
</ul>

These points goes beyond contributing to open-source projects because these can be applied to situations in life too. In order to grow, we must learn from what our
peers teach us. If we treat them nicely, they will treat us the same way, and sometimes even better. Additionally, most people, including myself, are inclined to
think that our method of solving a problem or completing a task is correct, but sometimes it's not necessarily the case. We must step back, reconsider everything and
understand that there are other, and possibly better, ways to complete the task ahead. Last but not least, we should do things that we enjoy or find interesting as
you will be more active and willing to think of ideas that would improve the situation.

<h4>Update!</h4>
We had the honor of having <strong><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/bacharakis/">Christos Bacharakis</a></strong> from Mozilla coming to our class as a guest speaker. We have prepared some questions for him to answer, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/wiki/wiki/Questions-for-Christos-Bacharakis">here</a>.

In this session, he began with an introduction of himself and his story of how he got into Open Source. His role is to mentor students on open source and how to get involved in the open source community. He had not only clearly explained Mozilla's goal of establishing an open web but also the steps and projects that they are taking to achieve it. Additionally, he showed an amazing <a href="https://fixme.ossn.club">website</a> that <em>helps contributors find open source projects based on their skills and abilities</em>. When Christos mentioned this in class and showed us how to use it, I was mindblown because I feel like it will be an exceptionally helpful tool in helping me get used to contributing to open source projects as I am still a beginner. In the end, he also passed around stickers!

This one is personally my favorite:

Thanks for reading!
