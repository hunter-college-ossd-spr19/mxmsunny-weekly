The difference between the definitions of Open Source and Free Software!

After having read [The Open Source Initiative's Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)
and [The Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
, the difference between the two definitions is the naming and how people have established different views
and approaches from it. Specifically, the term, "free," in free software refers to **freedom** and providing users
"the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software," but the term can also connote "zero
cost" or "give away," which could lead to misunderstandings. Thus, the term, open source, was introduced to reduce
possible misunderstandings of free software because people believed it provided a clearer description 
of the software and its creators’ intent for how it should be used. Though open source and free software have similar
definitions and describe almost the same category of software, the definition of open source focuses more on requirements
of the license of a program whereas the definition of free software focuses on the software being able to exercise
the four freedoms. 

**Update:** We had a class discussion on the differences between the definitions of Open Source and Free Software, and
this is what we shared, which were similar to mine. As a class, we stated that Free Software is more like a **philosophy and/or 
ideology** with a set of *freedoms*, and that Open Source is still a working definition. Another thing we discussed is that
for Free Software, everything used must be considered free software, whereas everything used in Open Source does not need to
be open source, only the source code that you are modifying.

## Contributing to OpenStreetMaps

This is my first time contributing to OpenStreetMaps, and it was very enjoyable. In class, my mentor, Jessica, taught our group the basics of OpenStreetMaps such as how to edit, save changes, etc. I was more familiar with my neighborhood, compared to Hunter and my hometown, so I decided to make changes there. The first change I made was removing Georgia Diner, a popular diner that [merged with Nevada Diner in 2013](https://qns.com/story/2018/02/12/georgia-diner-elmhurst-close-doors-march-merge-nevada-diner/). Following that, I removed the parking lot behind Georgia Diner, since it was torn down in 2017 and is currently under construction to create a commercial-residential building. Next, I added a fast food restaurant called [Cheers Cut](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cheers-cut-elmhurst-3) that was on the same block as the Grand Av-Newtown Station. In the same area, I updated the information of my local supermarket, [New Golden Sparkling](https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-golden-sparkling-elmhurst) or 新金麟超市(xin1 jin1 lin1 chao1 shi4). I have put the address and added in the hours of operation and its name.
Lastly, I included more information for my local library, the [Elmhurst branch of Queens Library](http://www.queenslibrary.org/branch/elmhurst/?filters=ev_loc:93200000), also commonly referred to as Elmhurst Library. The information added was indicating that it is a civic building and wheelchair accessible, its hours of operation and address.
