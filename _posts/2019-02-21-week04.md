title: Week 4

<br />
Last week, we have done project evaluations for the following open source projects: 
[DOxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/), [Netflix Conductor](https://netflix.github.io/conductor/), and [OpenFoodFacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/). <br />
In this week's blog post, I shall be a <strong> reflecting </strong> on my experience with the project evaluation assignment of the projects listed above. <br />
When I first opened the project evaluation assignment, I knew that it would be quite time-consuming given the amount of questions we had to answer, and
as I was completing the assignemnt, it indeed did take quite some time to finish. Specifically, there were questions that asked us to find how long issues
and pull requests tend to stay ope. In order to figure that out, we needed to take the twenty most recently closed issues and pull requests and compute the
number of days that each was open and take the average. There was no easy way to do this, so I had to manually open the twenty most recently closed issues and
pull request, and then write down and calculate the average. This had to be done for <em> all </em> of the projects assigned, so that definitely took a while
to finish. However, although repetitive and time-consuming, it was definitely really helpful and useful because through this project, I've learned more 
about the different functions that GitHub has to offer and I also now know what issues and pull requests tend to look like. Furthermore, I gained more
insight on how to check if an open source project is still active or the current status of a project. If I click on the <em> Insights </em> tab, I can see how many
contributions and pull requests have been made by how many people within a certain span of time. Additionally, there are more tabs within the Insights tab that show
if the project has a Code of Conduct, README, Contributing, and so on. I could also check which periods of time had the most contributors/contributions made as well as
how many total contributors were there from the start to today. <br />
I still find myself inexperienced, but if I had to propose another way of evaluating a project, it would be similar to that of the project evaluation assignment, but
there will be a few changes. Instead of calculating the average of the total amount of days the twenty most recent pull requests and issues were open, I would just
look at how many issues have been closed within the past two weeks, because that indicates that are people still contributing to the project itself. Granted, this would
not show how long an issue or pull request had been opened, but knowing that there are people who are still resolving these things still can contribute to showing how
active a project is. However, it is still important to know how long it has been opened, so maybe there could be a program or an API that can compute how long the top X 
amount of issues have been opened. <br />
