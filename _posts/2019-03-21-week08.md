Hey all! This week's blog will be a detailed progress report on what I did this week on the [OSNY-App](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY)

First on the list, we have decided to make pull requests to the class organization's OSNY fork instead of the separate one we have been using for the past few weeks. Thus, all of our future issues and pull requests will be in [here](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/OpenSource-NY)

Within this week, we have been trying to optimize and clean the code, as well as make the documentation clearer. I have been commenting on a few pull requests and issues that dealt with what was stated above. The README, specifically how to run and install, has been updated, and Andrey has uploaded a boilerplate for us to use.

I have accepted two pull requests so far. The [first one](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/pull/57) refers to updating the README, and I have written down my own opinion about whether having a reference link to "Dependecy" was needed in the "How to Install" section as it is right above it. The [second one](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/pull/58) is about boundary checks in the code, and I believe it has also made the code cleaner and readable. 

I haven't contributed to the code this week, but I wanted to add a username textbox since it was implied [here](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/issues/36) that we should exclude the password textbox. However, before I did, I replied to the chain asking if it is necessary as of now. Yi Zong replied saying that it is not necessary now, so I will push that aside until we get most of the important aspects of the app completed.

So far, there is a discussion going on with the [boilerplate](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/OpenSource-NY/pull/2), so hopefully we can get that sorted out soon.

To recap: this week, I have been working with the community by commenting on pull requests and issues as well as merging some pull requests. I haven't contributed to the code, but I hope to do so in the following week since I believe I will mainly be focusing on documentation and front-end.

## Contributions:
On the other hand, I have made some more contributions to OpenStreetMaps, which can be found [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/68297120)

In short, I have added a bakery, Vanilla Cafe Pastry Garden, and a fast food chain, Sonic, located near the Flushing Main St area.

This compilation of all of the Pokemon Route themes have been keeping me motivated and going throughout these past few days! Please listen [here](https://youtu.be/zDBPh1W1LJM) and have a nice nostalgic trip as you study or relax from the stress of work or midterms!

Thanks for reading!
