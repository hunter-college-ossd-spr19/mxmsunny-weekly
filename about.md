Hi, and welcome to my blog! My name is Xiangmin Mo. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Chinese, and minoring in Mathematics.

I hope to create applications that can help people overcome the English-Chinese language barrier or promote communication between people in U.S. and China. Additionally, I wish to develop or help design games in the future as I learn more about coding, and dive deeper into the technical world!

By sharing my experiences throughout this semester through my weekly blog posts, I hope that we can grow together.

### More Information

I am part of Hunter College's Chinese Flagship Program, which is a "rigorous undergraduate program of study in Chinese language and culture that aims to enable highly-motivated undergraduate students to become global professionals." I enjoy working with people, and I am always willing to learn. My favorite color is green, and I enjoy listening to k-pop, j-pop, and OSTs and BGMs from games.

My hobbies include:

- Coding
- Drawing
- Gaming
- Hiking
- Badminton
- Reading
