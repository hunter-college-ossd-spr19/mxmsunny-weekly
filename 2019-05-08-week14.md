Hello, everyone! I hope that you all had a great weekend. Even though finals are coming up, it is still important to take breaks and enjoy yourself. In this class, we will have a presentation of our projects that we have worked on for a huge chunk of this semester. Our group, the OSNY-App group, is scheduled to preesent on May 10th, which is this **coming** Friday . As of May 7th, the first group which contributed to Apache Cassandra, has already presented. I really enjoyed their presentation because they wer ereally detailed and I could see their hardwork and passion from their working on their project.

Before continuing on to what is going on with our project as of now, we were tasked to read Tom Callaway's [Musings on Business Models for Open Source Software](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html). Callaway categorizes the current existing business models for open source software companies: ***Consultancies, Subscription Offerings, Donation Model, Open Core, Software as a Service(*** *SaaS* ***), Peace of Mind,*** and ***FUD***. Additionally, Callaway seems to support the **Peace of Mind** business model, which is the idea in which companies can pay other companies to "act as an intermediary to the open source projects that they consume (mostly in the web framework space). They then sponsor and support those community projects so that they remain healthy and useful for their customers." I agree with Callaway's opinion because customers will have sort of a hub or a single website with many different open source software companies, and from that website, they are exposed to many new companies that might be more useful that the current popular ones. To my knowledge, I think most websites use the Donation business model.

Going back to the project, I have so far just added the icon to the website. The PR can be found [here](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/OpenSource-NY/pull/14). The backend team is also making progress. I plan to do a whole redecoration of the website, so stay tuned!

Thanks for reading!
